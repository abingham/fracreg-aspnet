This directory should contain images for the various AO codes. It has
been left empty until we can determine the license issues surrounding
the use of the various image sets available.

You can populate this directory with any image set you want. Simply
follow the format <AO code in all caps without spaces>.jpg. For
example, the image for code "31 A2" would be "31A2.jpg". 

Sorry for the inconvenience. Hopefully we'll be able to bundle images
with fracreg in the future.
